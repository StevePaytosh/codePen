    <div class="about col-xs-2 col-md-3">Rurouni, better known as Ronin, was a great friend and companion. She came to my family as a stray kitten who followed my dad, back and forth, as he mowed the lawn one day. 
      After sleeping the next several nights on our porch, she was brought into our family.
      <p><br>
        Her name is drawn from the manga series Rurouni Kenshin. The term Rurouni is a extension of the Japanese term ronin, which is a masterless samurai. Since she was a stray cat, I felt that this was a good name for her. 
        <p><br>
          Ronin had one favorite hobby, and that was waiting for me. Whenever I was home she would spend as much time as she could right by my side. She spent almost every night sleeping next to me and would often wake me up just to let her under the blanket. 
         <p><br>
           Ronin will be remembered as a deeply affectionate cat who's loyalty was unsurpassed.
