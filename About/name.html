        <div class="profile-text">
          <p>My name is Steve Paytosh, I was born and raised in Lorain, Ohio. Lorain is a modestly sized city not too far away from Cleveland. It is home to a highly diverse poplulation of individuals who's ancestors came from all over the world for find work. These days, that work is gone as the city has become the standard for rust belt towns.</p>
          
          <p>Having seen the strugles of middle class labor first hand has motivated me to acquire not only a college degree, but usefull skills. So I am pursing a degree in Computer Science from the University of Toledo.</p>
          <p>
            As part of my education,I work as a co-op for Ridgid Software Solutions, where I have worked with both web development and big data.</p><p> 
          I personally believe that javascript will be the way of the future and that the machines won't be conquering humanity because javascript will have already done it.</p>
          <p>
          I'm open to pretty much all aspects of Computer Science, so until I've set my sights to a unique application of coding, I will let the great digital wind take me wherever it sees fit.
          </p>
          <p>
         One of the more interesting stops on my journey thus far has been a website dedicated to teaching web development, it's called FreeCodeCamp. They do some amazing work and I highly recommend checking them out.

      <div id="quick-title">Software Engineer</div>
      <p>In my first 3 years as an engineering major, I have seen the tip of a giant iceburg called technology</p>
      <p>My programming is built on a foundation of object oriented programming using the Java language. This includes a class in linear data structures.</p>
      <p>Built on top of java is the use of low level languages with MASM as part of class on computer architecture. This allows for the lower level use of C++ covered in non-linear data structures.</p>
      <p>In the field, I have seen the concepts learned in the classroom applied to real life scenarios. 
      </p>  
        <p>One of the major concepts that I learned about in the field is source control. Many of the problems that plagued flash-drive based versioning were suddenly eliminated. </p>
      <p>This opened the door to handling large projects utilizing C#,HTML,CSS,Javascript,SQL server, APIs and powershell.</p>
      <p>My next turn in the field will be sure to add much more content to this section.</p>
